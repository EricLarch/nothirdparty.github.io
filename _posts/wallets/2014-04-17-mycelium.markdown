##Security
{: .security .wallet-sections}
Mycelium, founded in 2008, is a Bitcoin company with 35 employees located in Europe, Asia, and America. Mycelium offers mobile wallets for iPhone and Android. All of Mycelium’s applications are open source.

Mycelium is a good option for new users, with basic features like watch-only addresses, cold storage spending, and HD accounts. Advanced options include TREZOR support, xpub/xpriv key exports, and decrypting BIP38 keys. Mycelium can also be used to restore a TREZOR seed.

##Privacy
{: .privacy .wallet-sections}
A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. Mycelium encrypts all your data and keys. An unrooted (Android)/non-jailbroken (iOS) device should be used.

Users can create a backup by writing down the 12 word seed provided in the app. If the phone is reset or lost, all funds can be recovered by re-entering the seed.

Mycelium is a hot wallet and should not be used to store a significant amount of funds.
