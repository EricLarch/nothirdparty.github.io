Hive is a native, elegant Bitcoin wallet for Mac. It aims to be ‘human-friendly’ and supports over 30 languages. Wallets created with the mobile/web version cannot be imported to Hive Mac.

##Security
{: .security .wallet-sections}
Private keys are encrypted with a password and stored on your computer.  Hive is a hot wallet and should be used for small amounts of Bitcoin.

Your wallet and its keys can be backed up through Google Drive, Time Machine, or Dropbox.

##Privacy
{: .privacy .wallet-sections}
Hive Mac [creates one address](https://github.com/hivewallet/hive-mac/wiki/FAQ#can-i-create-more-than-one-address-or-multiple-wallets) which must be used to receive all funds. This is detrimental to privacy and allows others to see your entire transaction history.

Hive Mac uses bitcoinj and SPV to connect to the Bitcoin network. Peers can connect your IP address to the single address used in Hive.
