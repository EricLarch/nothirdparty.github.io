<p>Bitcoin the currency will change the global financial landscape. No Third Party provides you with the tools necessary to navigate the new P2P economy.

<p>Satoshi’s Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, had clear intentions. Here is the first sentence of his email introducing his new creation:</p>
<blockquote>I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully
peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/#selection-19.0-14.6">Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>Before Bitcoin, currency was government issued and electronic transactions required third party processing. Governments inflate money at will, stealing from entire populations. Many Argentinians have lost their life savings multiple times because of hyperinflation.</p>

<p>Services like bank wires, PayPal, and Western Union require trusted entities to move money and verify transactions. Trusted entities must follow strict regulations and can freeze funds at any time. Cypriots, who put their trust in banks, were unable to withdrawal their own money during the 2013 bailouts.</p>

<p>Bitcoin eliminates the need for trust in third parties. The supply of Bitcoin is known and visible to anyone who looks at <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">the code</a>. All bitcoin transactions are, like cash, made directly from person-to-person. Transactions are validated by Bitcoin miners. The network is for anyone to use and distributed–so no one entity has control and it cannot be shut down.</p>

<p>Use the network whenever. Leave whenever. Nobody can prevent you from creating an account. No one can force you to use Bitcoin. No one can freeze your funds. Bitcoin is voluntary.</p>

<p>What are the implications and benefits of finance with no third parties?</p>
<h3>Cryptographically Secure</h3>
<blockquote>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-37.4-37.325">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a></cite></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://coincenter.org/2014/12/bitcoin-mining/">Bitcoin miners</a> secure the network with proof of work. A bank account balance is simply a number in a database. You trust the bank to honor your balance. Bitcoin eliminates the need for trusted institutions. You can trust the network.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is like cash. If I own one bitcoin, I can be 100% sure I have one bitcoin. Bitcoin is secured by proof of work and can’t be counterfeited.</p>

<p>Trust computers instead of people.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-Peer</h3>
<blockquote>I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully
peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/#selection-19.0-14.6">Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>Peer-to-peer systems are voluntary. I can’t force you to use Bitcoin. You can’t force me. It’s a dumb network and accepts everyone. Bitcoin offers no barrier to entry.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions are faster, global, and cheap. Bitcoin can be sent from Canada to Japan in minutes, for a cost of about $0.02 no matter how large the transaction.</p>
<h3>Effortless Transactions</h3>
<blockquote>With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/1/#selection-41.43-2.19">Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>Financial institutions slow down payments. Bitcoin makes sending money almost instant. There’s no bank, and no hours. <a href="http://www.bitcoinuptime.com/">Bitcoin works 24/7</a>, anywhere with an internet connection. You can buy something or pay for services as fast as you can send an email. Payments, no matter how big or small, are now frictionless.</p>
<h3>No Need for Trust (Third Party)</h3>
<blockquote>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-45.4-45.286">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin gives us financial freedom. Governments can’t control the currency supply and inflate it recklessly. There will only be 21 million bitcoin. This is Bitcoin’s killer app.</p>

<p>With Bitcoin you own your money, and no one else can freeze your funds or payments.</p>
<blockquote>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
