We aim to provide accurate, up-to-date, and insightful information about Bitcoin wallets. Our content is made to be as factual as possible, and we do not accept payments in return for favorable reviews.

In the even that we review a product/service and receive it free of charge, we will disclose that information.

We invite the community to help contribute. Our entire website is on [GitHub][1]. We allow anyone to contribute to our [wallet pages][2] or [knowledge base][3].
