    Bitcoin wallets are the gateway to Satoshi Nakamoto’s dream of a peer-to-peer economy. At No Third Party, learning about Bitcoin wallets is simple.
    
    New Bitcoin users face the same question: which wallet should I use? Our wallet overviews–which are strictly facts and unbiased–make it easy to understand each Bitcoin wallet’s features, how it secures funds, and its level of privacy.
    
    Our blog helps keep you up-to-date with the latest Bitcoin wallet news, wallet updates, new features, analysis, and more.
    
    No Third Party was founded by Jordan Tuwiner in January 2015.
